			SoHo Reprographics began operation in a second floor walk-up on West Broadway in January of 1985. As a one machine
			copyshop and family-staffed word-processing service, we quickly became aware of the needs of local businesses and began to
			meet those needs. After four moves and 21 years, now located just a few blocks away at 381 Broome Street, we offer a full
			range of reprographic and printing services.
		</p>
		<p class="style15">
			Every day SoHo Reprographics makes blueprints, black &amp; white and color copies, business cards, saddle-stitched booklets,
			and more. We generate plots and color plots. We scan and typeset. We send and receive files electronically and output to a wide
			variety of output devices including camera-ready film and paper, Fiery, and plotters.
		</p>
		<p class="style15">
			Among our customers are architects, engineers, contractors, publishers, advertisers, designers, financial institutions and
			not-for-profit organizations.
		</p>
		<p class="style15">
			We have the equipment, people, and know-how to get almost anything done, often on the most unreasonable schedules. We
			work night and weekends, employ our own messengers, and we pay fanatical attention to details.
		</p>
		<p class="style15">
