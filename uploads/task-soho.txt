1. after a customer submits an order, the admin can edit the order and an update is sent to the customer
the email for the customer should be the email belonging to the user who placed the original order online




currently, after a customer places a supply order, the Admin is capable of modifying the order. We need a method of "closing" and order so that it cannot be modified further, and can therefore be billed for.
